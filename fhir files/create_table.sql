OPTIONS(description="This table stores FHIR Encounter resources.  Encounters represent interactions between a patient and healthcare provider(s) for the purpose of providing healthcare service(s) or assessing the health status of a patient.  Each row represents a single Encounter resource and conforms to the FHIR R4 specification (http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/encounter.html).  Key fields include: id (logical identifier), status (e.g., planned, arrived, triaged, in-progress, onleave, finished, cancelled, entered-in-error, unknown), class (e.g., inpatient, outpatient, ambulatory, emergency, home health, field, daycare, virtual), type (coded list of encounter types), subject (reference to the Patient resource), participant (references to healthcare professionals involved), period (start and end time of the encounter), location (where the encounter occurred), reasonCode (coded reason for the encounter), and serviceProvider (organization responsible for the encounter).  Data is stored in JSON format using the FHIR standard.  For detailed field descriptions and terminology, refer to the FHIR R4 Encounter resource documentation.");
