        "description": "The `allergy_intolerances` table is designed to store information about patients' allergies and intolerances, which are critical for ensuring safe medical care and treatment. This table is part of a larger relational database schema used in a healthcare setting, such as a hospital or clinic, to manage patient data efficiently.\n\n### Table Structure:\n\n- **allergy_id (Primary Key)**: A unique identifier for each allergy or intolerance record. This is typically an auto-incrementing integer that ensures each entry is distinct.\n\n- **patient_id (Foreign Key)**: A reference to the unique identifier of the patient in the `patients` table. This establishes a relationship between the patient and their recorded allergies or intolerances.\n\n- **substance**: A string field that specifies the substance to which the patient is allergic or intolerant. This could include medications, foods, environmental factors, etc.\n\n- **reaction**: A text field that describes the adverse reaction experienced by the patient upon exposure to the substance. This may include symptoms like rash, anaphylaxis, nausea, etc.\n\n- **severity**: A categorical field indicating the severity of the reaction, such as mild, moderate, or severe. This helps healthcare providers assess the risk associated with the allergy or intolerance.\n\n- **status**: A field that indicates the current status of the allergy or intolerance, such as active, inactive, or resolved. This helps in understanding whether the allergy is currently relevant to the patient's care.\n\n- **onset_date**: A date field that records when the allergy or intolerance was first identified or reported. This provides a timeline for the patient's allergy history.\n\n- **recorded_date**: A date field indicating when the allergy or intolerance was documented in the database. This helps track the currency of the information.\n\n- **notes**: An optional text field for additional comments or details about the allergy or intolerance, which may include information about testing, confirmation, or special instructions for care.\n\n### Purpose and Usage:\n\nThe `allergy_intolerances` table is crucial for maintaining comprehensive and up-to-date records of patient allergies and intolerances. It supports clinical decision-making by providing healthcare professionals with essential information to avoid adverse reactions during treatment. The table's design ensures that data is organized, accessible, and linked to the broader patient record system, facilitating seamless integration into electronic health records (EHR) and other healthcare applications.",
